# My First Terraform Project

Welcome to my first Terraform project! This project demonstrates the use of Terraform scripts to provision and manage infrastructure.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Showcase basic Terraform configuration and setup.
- Provision a simple infrastructure on AWS.
- Apply best practices in Terraform code organization and resource management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (version >= 0.12)
- [choose any cloud provider's CLI](e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Google Cloud SDK)
- [Optional] Git for version control

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-first-terraform-project.git
   cd my-first-terraform-project
   ```

2. **Initialize the Terraform project**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Configure your cloud provider credentials**

   Make sure your cloud provider CLI is configured with the necessary credentials. For example, for AWS, run:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

4. **Create a Terraform plan**

   Review the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure.

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the Terraform configuration**

   Apply the planned changes to create the infrastructure.

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the apply with `yes`.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a simple introduction to Terraform and its capabilities. As you continue to learn, you can expand this project with more complex resources and configurations. Happy Terraforming!
